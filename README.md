# Awesome Harvard Events

A collection of places to find awesome events across Harvard (primarily for students, but many events are open to the public).

## Grab Bag (TODO)

The Harvard Gazette appears to have an aggregation of most (all?) public events! You can find it at https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/harvard-events/events-calendar/ and there's even an iCal subscribe link. TODO figure out if anything is missing from this event list...
